    <p align="justify">
    Boston University is a private research university in Boston, Massachusetts. Despite being nonsectarian, the university has a long-standing connection to the United Methodist Church. It was established in 1839 by Methodists, with its initial campus located in Newbury, Vermont. In 1867, it relocated to Boston.<br />
The university, one of Boston's largest employers, currently employs more than 4,000 faculty members and close to 34,000 students. Through 17 schools and colleges spread across three urban campuses, it offers bachelor's degrees, master's degrees, doctorates, and degrees in medicine, dentistry, business, and law. The Boston University Medical Campus is situated in Boston's South End, while the main campus is located in the Fenway-Kenmore and Allston neighborhoods along the Charles River. The Fenway campus houses the Wheelock College of Education and Human Development, formerly Wheelock College, which merged with BU in 2018.

	<h1 align="center">Finding an Internship</h1>
  <p align="justify">
    An internship is a type of experiential learning that combines classroom knowledge and theory with real-world application and the growth of skills in a work environment. Employers can mentor and assess talent while guiding students toward valuable applied experience and connections in the professional fields they are considering for career paths through internships.<br /><br />
    Part-time vs. Full-time<br />
The time commitment also varies depending on what the employer needs. Some internships are full-time, but most are part-time.<br /><br />
    The Center for Career Development (CCD) can help if you're unsure of where you want your professional life to go. There, you can network with successful alumni, get resume assistance, look up job openings and online resources, and get professional advice from their staff members. A guide to finding an internship, information for international students, and tips on how to maximize your experience are all available at the center.<br />

To meet with an advisor, go to the <a href="https://www.bu.edu/cas/academics/undergraduate-education/academic-advising/advising/contact-and-staff/" title="Click here" id="CAS">CAS Advising Office</a> or the Office of Student Programs and Leadership, both of which are situated at 100 Bay State Road.
