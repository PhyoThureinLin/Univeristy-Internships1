	<h1>Summer Programs</h1>
	<p align="justify">Summer Programs are available to Princeton University students upon application and approval by the sponsoring department. Princeton does not have a regularly scheduled summer term for students other than those in Summer Programs. Please consult individual course descriptions for application restrictions and eligibility requirements.</p>
	<p align="justify">The Center for Career Development manages the Princeton in Washington and Arts at Work summer programs, which provide an opportunity to learn about a variety of career paths and make connections in public service, government, the arts and more.</p>
  <p align="justify"><a href="https://careerdevelopment.princeton.edu/piw" id="PIW">Princeton in Washington (PIW)</a>: Will you be living or interning in Washington, D.C. during the summer? PIW brings together students, alumni and insiders in the nation’s capital for speaker and panel discussions, site visits and social events.</p>

	<p align="justify">Each year a student coordinator organizes a full schedule with activities ranging from lectures from prestigious Princeton alumni to networking, gatherings and more.</p>
	<p align="justify"><a href="https://careerdevelopment.princeton.edu/artsatwork" id="AAW">Arts at Work</a>: Sponsored by the Center for Career Development, the Lewis Center for the Arts and with support from the Princeton Arts Alumni, the Arts at Work program connects students with alumni and visual artists, musicians, writers and others in creative fields.</p>
	<p align="justify"><strong>How long do summer programs tend to last?</strong></p>
	<p align="justify">Summer programs typically last from three weeks to a month and generally take place in the middle of the summer – around June or July. Of course, this can vary depending on the school or organization hosting the summer program.</p>
	<p align="justify"><strong>How hard is it to get into a summer program?</strong></p>
	<p align="justify">There are a good number of selective summer programs for high school students. As with universities, the more popular the summer program, the harder it is to get into. Generally, those offered by an Ivy League school are the most difficult to qualify for yet the most rewarding. That’s why it’s important to choose programs within your field of interest to increase your chances of getting in.</p>
	<p align="justify"><strong>What are summer programs like?</strong></p>
	<P align="justify">Typically, summer programs are hosted on a college campus and are designed to simulate a standard college experience. Participants usually stay overnight on campus, although local students might have the option to commute. Classes, lectures, and projects are generally completed in a classroom setting, led by professors of the university where it’s held.</P>
